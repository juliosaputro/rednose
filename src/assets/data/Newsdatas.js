        desc:"The COVID-19 pandemic is still a big challenge for all of us, and in order to overcome this, we are required to do one essential thing: being vaccinated. As a donation partner, NIKE invited RNF's staff and its surrounding community to be vaccinated. The vaccination program took place at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on August 27th, 2021. We can now proudly state that all RNF office and field staff have been vaccinated. It was a conscious decision on our part to support the government's vaccination campaign. Furthermore, RNF hopes that we can set a positive example for other communities and encourage them to get their vaccine.",
